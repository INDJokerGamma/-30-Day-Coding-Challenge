Q) Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n= nums.size();
        return nums[n/2];
    }
};


THOUGHT PROCESS
the question was easy, if any element ouccrs more than half the size of the array, then when sorting the array the middle element is definetly the majority number.
