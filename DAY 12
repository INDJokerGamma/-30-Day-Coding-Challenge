11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

code:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) 
    {
      int left =0;
      int right= height.size() -1;
      int maxarea=0;

      while(left < right)
      {
        int currarea= min(height[left], height[right]) * (right -left);
        maxarea= max(maxarea, currarea);

        if (height[left] < height[right])
            left++;

        else
            right--;
      }
    return maxarea;
    }
};
